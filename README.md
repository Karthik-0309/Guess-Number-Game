## 🕹️ How to Play

1. A **secret number** between **1 and 20** is randomly generated.
2. Enter your guess in the input box.
3. Click the **"Check!"** button to submit your guess.
4. The game will give feedback:
   - 🎉 **Correct Number!** – if you guessed right.
   - 📉 **Too low!** – if your guess is lower than the secret number.
   - 📈 **Too high!** – if your guess is higher than the secret number.
5. Your **score** starts at 20 and decreases with every wrong guess.
6. If the score reaches 0, the message **"💥 You lost the game!"** is displayed.
